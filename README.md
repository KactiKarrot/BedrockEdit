# BedrockEdit
BedrockEdit is a collection of tools and utilities for, you guessed it, the bedrock edition.\
To run the first time setup of the BedrockEdit system, run
```
/function bedrockedit/setup
```
If you want to get the items used to control the system, run
```
/function bedrockedit/items
```
That is all you need to do to get BedrockEdit ready to go! Most of these features are designed entirely by me, if you have seen them elsewhere then that is only a coincidence. Some are made by my friends and have given me permission to put them in here. Parts of this are called WorldEdit, however this project is not part of that Java edition mod whatsoever, it only shares similar uses.
