# BedrockEdit
## Description
BedrockEdit is a collection of tools and utilities for, you guessed it, the bedrock edition.\
To run the first time setup of the BedrockEdit system, run
```
/function bedrockedit/setup
```
If you want to get the items used to control the system, run
```
/function bedrockedit/items
```
That is all you need to do to get BedrockEdit ready to go! Please note that none of this uses custom commands as that is not currently possible in the Bedrock version. To use you drop the item named after the function you want to use. Most of these features inner workings are designed entirely by me, if you have seen them elsewhere then that is only a coincidence. Some are made by my friends and have given me permission to put them in here.
## Features
### How to Use
As I said, run the above commands to run the one time setup and give yourself the items used in the system.
### Outline
The Outline item toggles on and off the outline used to preview what will be copied or where it will be pasted. It is reccomended to use the outline so you do not acidentally destroy a build, however on some lower end devices it may cause some framerate issues.
### Copy and Paste
One of the main features of this pack is the ability to copy and paste structures in your world. You can do so in the sizes of 5x5x5, 10x10x10, 15x15x15, and 20x20x20. You choose the size you want to copy with the Size item. You can then choose options such as including blocks and including entities. After you choose the desired options, you can drop the Copy item and the highlighted area will be copied. You can then choose other options before you paste, including:
-Mirroring over the X axis
-Mirroring over the Z axis
-Rotation
The rotation available is 0째, 90째, 180째, and 270째. When you have a rotation selected, the outline will show you where corner closest to you when saved will end up.
### WorldPainter - Not Done
The WorldPainter tool was created by me and a friend of mine. It is quite a simple tool. It allows you to choose a block to paint with (Grass, Stone, Dirt, Air), and the size of it, and then whereever you look the blocks are placed. You can also do snow which will be placed in a 5x5 layer. If you are no a lower end device this can lag your game, especially if repeatedly dropped. I am aware that other people have created a similar system that works on the same principle as this, however we made this entirely on our own.
### Stone Replacer - Not Done
This one not everyone may find as useful but I use it so I have chosen to include it anyways. This one replaces all unpolished diorite, granite, and andesite with regular stone within a 31x31x31 block area around the player. This can be used if you are creating custom caves and don't want the vanilla generation in your way.
### Entity Eraser(Non-Player) - Not Done
Kills all non-player entities within a 10 block radius.
### Entity Eraser - Not Done
Kills all entities within a 10 block radius.
### Deforester - Not Done
As the name implies, will destroy all log and leaf blocks within a 31x31x31 block area of the player. This will destroy builds that have logs or leaves in them.
### Eraser - Not Done
A placeable entity that will destroy all blocks within 7 blocks in each direction, in which it only goes 1.
### Flatten - Not Done
Flattens the area within 10 blocks of the player when dropped, destroying all blocks within 15 blocks above it.
### Flatten with Grass - Not Done
Flattens the area within 10 blocks of the player when dropped, destroying all blocks within 15 blocks above it and placing grass below the player.
