# BedrockEdit
BedrockEdit is a collection of tools and utilities for, you guessed it, the bedrock edition.\
To run the first time setup of the BedrockEdit system, run
```
/function bedrockedit/setup
```
If you want to get the items used to control the system, run
```
/function bedrockedit/items
```
That is all you need to do to get BedrockEdit ready to go! Most of these features are designed entirely by me, if you have seen them elsewhere then that is only a coincidence. Some are made by my friends and have given me permission to put them in here.
## Features
### Copy and Paste
One of the main features of this pack is the ability to copy and paste structures in your world
